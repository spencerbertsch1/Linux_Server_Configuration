# Linux Server Configuration

This is the last project in the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree. 

This project is designed to teach students how to prepare a baseline linux server to host a flask application. This process includes things such as installing necessary software, configuring firewalls, and installing/ configuring a PostgreSQL database on the server to run as the backend for the application.

## Resources

During this project I relied on several tutorials and outside resources. See some of the more helpful ones below:

I also saw many other Udacity student's github accounts showing steps to complete this project. These often yeilded conflicting information and, although sometimes helpful, were'nt an extremely useful resource in configuring the server correctly.
